PARAGRAPH = ("Artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing have rapidly evolved into mutually reinforcing pillars of modern digital ecosystems, transforming industries, accelerating research, and reshaping education, business, and software development. As organizations move beyond experimentation, AI is shifting from an add‑on technology to a foundational layer embedded across applications, services, and operations. This transition is visible in enterprise environments, higher education, software engineering curricula, and global technology strategy. Cloud platforms provide the scalable compute, storage, networking, and distributed architectures needed for AI models to be trained, deployed, and continuously improved. In turn, AI enhances how cloud systems operate—optimizing resource allocation, automating security monitoring, enabling intent‑based development, accelerating DevOps workflows, and powering intelligent analytics that help institutions and businesses make data‑driven decisions. At the center of this technological convergence is a growing demand for systems that are scalable, cost‑efficient, secure, and capable of supporting increasingly complex AI workloads.")
